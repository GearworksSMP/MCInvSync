# InvSync

This is a fabric mod for 1.16, 1.17, and 1.18 that Allows you to sync player inventories, health, food level, experience, score and status effects across multiple servers or single player minecraft worlds! This is accomplished using an sql database (SQLite and MySQL supported. SQLite will be setup automatically, you must set up MySQL). Most mods should have no problem running along side, and modded items will also be sync'd.

## Requirements

- This mod requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) 
- You can get the mod on [Modrith](https://modrinth.com/mod/invsync)

## Getting Started

Setup is very simple. Drop the mod into your mods folder on all the servers you want to sync. Starting a server will generate a config. The mod will not run until you edit the config.

## IMPORTANT NOTES 

- Configs MUST be identical between all participating servers in order for the mod to function correctly.
- This mod is known to have issues with: **GolfV**
